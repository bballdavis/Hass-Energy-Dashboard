# Energy Dashboard

A Home Assistant custom dashboard for visualizing and managing power and energy entities. Includes two main cards:
- **Entity Card**: Select, filter, and control which entities are shown.
- **Chart Card**: Visualize power and energy usage with configurable charts.

## Requirements

- **apexcharts-card is required** for the chart card to function. Install it via HACS before using this dashboard.

## Installation in HACS

1. Go to HACS in Home Assistant.
2. Click the three dots (â‹®) in the top right and select **Custom repositories**.
3. Add this repository's URL as a custom repository (select type: "Dashboard").
4. Search for **Energy Dashboard** and install it as a dashboard.
5. Install **apexcharts-card** (search for "ApexCharts Card" in HACS and install).
6. Refresh your browser and add the cards to your dashboard from the UI.

## Card Layout & Home Assistant Recommendations

These cards are designed to be managed by the Home Assistant Layout control. For best results:
- **Chart Card**: Set width to **24** (full-width in most layouts)
- **Entity Card**: Set width to **9** (sidebar style)

This ensures the chart is large and readable, while the entity card remains compact and easy to use.
